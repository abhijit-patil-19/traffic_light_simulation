# traffic_light_simulation

This project is simulation of 4 way traffic light control along with pedestrian lights done using Proteus. 

Components:
Arduino uno
Red, yellow, green leds
1kΩ resistor
220Ω resistors
Push button switch

Traffic system in this project is automatic time based traffic control system, it does not contain any sensor for taking input about density of traffic. This is 4 way traffic control and the pedestrian traffic is controlled using the push button switch.
